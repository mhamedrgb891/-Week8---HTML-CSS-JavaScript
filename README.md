# Week 8 – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Part of CS50x 2025 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University

## Overview
This week marked the transition from low-level programming in C to web development. We explored how websites are structured and styled using HTML and CSS, and how they become interactive with JavaScript.

## Topics Covered
- HTML elements and semantic structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for interactivity
- DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript

## Projects
- Homepage (Build a personal website)
- Other optional interactive pages

## Key Takeaways
- Learned to create and style responsive webpages.
- Gained experience in writing clean HTML and organizing CSS rules effectively.
- Used JavaScript to respond to user interactions dynamically.
- Understood how to manipulate page content through the DOM.

## Challenges
Making the website fully responsive and ensuring cross-browser compatibility required careful use of CSS. JavaScript DOM manipulation was a new but exciting challenge that brought the pages to life.

## How to Run
Open the HTML file in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
